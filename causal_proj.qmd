## Types of Missingness

1. Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
2. Missing at Random (MAR)
3. Missing Not at Random (MNAR)

> MCAR is best case and induces minimal bias using classical techniques, while MNAR is worst case and the missing data has a pattern to it.

# Motivating Example

## Clinical Trial with dropout

- Clinical trial data for depression medication
    - Missing data not at random
    - Often the case in clinical trials
- Using a new machine learning imputation methods @haliduola_missing_2022 were able to impute MNAR data.

Using this data and imputation method do we achieve different conclusions between complete case analysis and Imputation?

## Machine learning Imputation

- 4 step imputation process combining clustering, oversampling, and RNNs
- Important to account for the subject effects as well as the time and treatment

## Trend

```{r}
#| fig-align: "center"

complete_case |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = score, color = as.factor(treat))) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.15) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("forestgreen", "sandybrown")) +
  labs(title = "Trend lines by treatment group", color = "Treatment") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

- Crossover at week 2
    - From 0 to 1 both trends look fairly parallel

## Treatment

```{r}
#| fig-align: "center"

longi_score |> 
  filter(week == 0) |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(base, `HAMA TOTAL`, score),
    names_to = "measure",
    values_to = "value") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = value, group = as.factor(treat))) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = as.factor(treat)), alpha = .9) +
  facet_wrap(~measure, scales = "free_x") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkblue", "cornflowerblue")) +
  labs(title = "Patient Distribution by Treatment", subtitle = "Values from week 0",
       fill = "Treatment") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Based on these values the treatment looks to be well randomized

# Complete case Analysis

## Methods

1. Difference-in-Difference (DID)
2. IP-weighted DID

> Consider differences from week 0 to week 6 as well as week 2 to week 6 due to the crossover observed at week 2.

## Difference-in-Difference (DID) {.smaller}

- The DID estimator is not significant with an estimated 95% CI of -1.1 to 0.03 from weeks 0 to 6
- Also not significant from weeks 2 to 6 with wider interval and higher p-value

:::{.columns}
::::{.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| tbl-cap: "Difference in difference estimates week 0 to 6"

complete_data <- complete_case |> 
  filter(week %in% c(0, 6))

did_reg <- lm(score ~ treat + week + DID, 
              data = complete_data)

tbl_regression(did_reg)
```
::::

::::{.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| tbl-cap: "Difference in difference estimates week 2 to 6"

did_last <- complete_case |> 
  filter(week %in% c(2, 6)) |> 
  lm(score ~ treat + week + DID, data = _)

tbl_regression(did_last)
```
::::

## IP-weighting


```{r}

ps_mod <- complete_case |> 
  filter(week %in% c(0, 6)) |> 
  glm(treat ~ sex + base, family = "binomial", data = _)

ps <- as.numeric(predict(ps_mod, type = "response"))

wls <- lm(score ~ treat + week + DID, 
              data = complete_data, weights = ps)

tbl_regression(wls)
```

```{r}

ps_mod <- complete_case |> 
  filter(week %in% c(2, 6)) |> 
  glm(treat ~ sex + base, family = "binomial", data = _)

ps <- as.numeric(predict(ps_mod, type = "response"))

wls <- complete_case |> 
  filter(week %in% c(2, 6)) |> 
  lm(score ~ treat + week + DID, 
              data = _, weights = ps)

tbl_regression(wls)
```

# Imputed Data


## Imputed values

```{r}
imput_data <- read_csv("data/pred_real_data.csv")

imputed_values <- imput_data |> 
  summarise(
    value = mean(predict),
    .by = c(id, week)
  )

new_data <- left_join(longi_score, imputed_values, by = c("id", "week")) |> 
  mutate(score = if_else(is.na(score), value, score)) |> 
  select(-value)

new_data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = score)) +
  geom_jitter(width = .15) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = "Imputed"), se = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(data = longi_score, se = FALSE, aes(color = "Complete case")) +
  facet_wrap(~treat) +
  labs(title = "Weekly Response with Imputed Values",
       color = "Line") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("cornflowerblue", "forestgreen")) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Imputed DID

Using DID we can estimate the causal effect using the differences of treated and untreated at week 1 and week 6.

- The DID estimator is not significant with an estimated 95% CI of -1.0 to 0.36

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: "Difference in difference regression estimates with imputed values"



did_reg <- new_data |> 
  filter(week %in% c(1, 6)) |>
  mutate("DID" = treat * week) |> 
  lm(score ~ treat + week + DID, 
              data = _)

tbl_regression(did_reg)
```

## Imputed IP-weighting

```{r}

ps_mod_i <- new_data |> 
  filter(week %in% c(1, 6)) |> 
  glm(treat ~ sex + base, family = "binomial", data = _)

ps_i <- as.numeric(predict(ps_mod_i, type = "response"))

wls_i <- new_data |> 
  filter(week %in% c(1, 6)) |> 
  mutate("DID" = treat * week) |> 
  lm(score ~ treat + week + DID, 
              data = _, weights = ps_i)

tbl_regression(wls_i)
```
