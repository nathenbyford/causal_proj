## Types of Missingness

1. Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
2. Missing at Random (MAR)
3. Missing Not at Random (MNAR)

# Motivating Example

## Clinical Trial with dropout

- Clinical trial data for depression medication
    - Missing data not at random
- Do Causal Inference methods provide biased results for complete case analysis compared to imputation?
