## Types of Missingness

1. Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
2. Missing at Random (MAR)
3. Missing Not at Random (MNAR)

> MCAR is best case and induces minimal bias using classical techniques, while MNAR is worst case and the missing data has a pattern to it. @little_statistical_2019

# Motivating Example

## Clinical Trial with dropout

- Clinical trial data for anxiety medication
    - Missing data not at random
    - Often the case in clinical trials
- Using a new machine learning imputation methods @haliduola_missing_2022 were able to impute MNAR data.

Using this data and imputation method do we achieve different conclusions between complete case analysis and Imputation?

## Machine learning Imputation

- 4 step imputation process combining clustering, oversampling, and RNNs
- Important to account for the subject effects as well as the time and treatment

- Score is based on HAMA (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale)

## Trend

```{r}
#| fig-align: "center"

complete_case |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = score, color = as.factor(treat))) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.15) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("forestgreen", "sandybrown")) +
  labs(title = "Trend lines by treatment group", color = "Treatment") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

- Crossover at week 2
    - From 0 to 1 both trends look fairly parallel

## Treatment

```{r}
#| fig-align: "center"

longi_score |> 
  filter(week == 0) |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(base, `PGI IMPROVEMENT`, sex),
    names_to = "measure",
    values_to = "value") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = value, group = as.factor(treat))) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = as.factor(treat)), alpha = .9) +
  facet_wrap(~measure, scales = "free") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkblue", "cornflowerblue")) +
  labs(title = "Patient Distribution by Treatment", subtitle = "Values from week 0",
       fill = "Treatment") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Based on these values the treatment looks to be well randomized

# Complete case Analysis

## Methods

1. Difference-in-Difference (DID)
2. IP-weighting

> Consider differences from week 0 to week 6 as well as week 2 to week 6 due to the crossover observed at week 2.

## Assumptions

- SUTVA: Clinical trial randomization should keep patients independent.
- Positivity: Good randomization variable levels across treatment group, probability of treatment is between 0 and 1.
- Parallel trends: Looking back at week 0 to week 1 differences appear parallel. If there is a potential lag for drug to kick in, this shows parallel trends. 

## Difference-in-Difference (DID) {.smaller}

- The DID estimator is not significant with an estimated 95% CI of -1.1 to 0.03 from weeks 0 to 6
- Also not significant from weeks 2 to 6 with wider interval and higher p-value

## IP-weighting

- Across the full length of study the iteration between treatment and time is significant estimated to be -0.59
- No significant estimate for weeks 2 to 6

  labs(title = "Trend lines by treatment group", subtitle = "With imputed values",

  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Imputed DID {.smaller}

- The DID estimator is significant with an estimated 95% CI of -1.0 to -0.07 over the full length of the study
- When narrowing down to weeks 2 to 6 we see a not significant estimate

## Imputed IP-weighting

- Using IPTW for to estimate the treatment effect over the course of the study and the latter part of the study
    - Significant across the full length of study
    - Not significant over last 4 weeks

```{r}

ps_mod_i <- new_data |> 
  filter(week %in% c(0, 6)) |> 
  glm(treat ~ sex + base, family = "binomial", data = _)

ps_i <- as.numeric(predict(ps_mod_i, type = "response"))

wls_i <- new_data |> 
  filter(week %in% c(0, 6)) |> 
  lm(score ~ treat + week + treat*week, 
              data = _, weights = ps_i)

tbl_regression(wls_i)

::::{.column width="50%"}

wls_i <- new_data |> 
  filter(week %in% c(2, 6)) |> 
  lm(score ~ treat + week + treat*week, 
              data = _, weights = ps_i)

## Conclusion

- We see that using imputation provides similar estimates of the ATT compared to complete case analysis
    - Using DID we saw estimates of -0.51 for complete case and -0.54 with imputed data
    - Using IPTW we saw -0.59 and -0.61 for complete case and imputation
- At the 5% significance level the DID results were not significant in complete case

## Discussion

- Overall the analysis doesn't change much from complete case to imputed value
    - Estimated change slightly
    - Some improvement in significance is gained
- IPTW was significant in both cases providing similar results
    - Appears to be more robust to missing values
